## 1. Phone Verification for Registration
- **Files**: `src/pages/SignupPage.jsx`, `src/supabase/auth.js`, `supabase` auth configuration
- **Issue**: Enable phone verification during user registration to ensure valid contact information and improve account security
- **Status**: Pending
- **Use Case**:
  - User signs up via web form
  - System sends verification code to provided phone number
  - User enters code to complete registration
  - Prevents fake or incorrect phone numbers from being saved
- **Implementation**:
  - Configure Supabase (or preferred provider) for SMS-based OTP verification
  - Update signup form to collect phone number in E.164 format
  - Add UI flow for sending and verifying OTP codes
  - Prevent account creation until phone number is verified
  - Store verification status in user profile (e.g., `phone_verified` flag)
  - Handle resending codes and rate limiting
  - Provide clear error handling and messaging for failed verifications
  - Ensure accessibility and responsive design of verification steps
  - Write tests or QA plan covering successful verification and error cases
  - Document verification flow for support and operations teams
